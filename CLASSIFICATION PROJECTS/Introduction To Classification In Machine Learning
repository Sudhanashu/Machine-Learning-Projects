Classification in Machine Learning

This repository focuses on classification algorithms and their applications in machine learning. Classification is a supervised learning technique used to categorize data into predefined classes, solving problems across domains like healthcare, finance, and image recognition.

Contents:
Algorithm Implementations: Step-by-step examples of popular classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks.
Use Cases: Practical projects such as spam detection, disease prediction, sentiment analysis, and image classification.
Performance Metrics: Tutorials on evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Datasets and Preprocessing: Insights into handling real-world data, feature engineering, and data cleaning for classification tasks.
This repository is ideal for anyone seeking to learn, implement, or explore classification techniques in machine learning, with a focus on practical, real-world applications.
