Repository Description:-  

Medical Insurance Cost Prediction System:-  

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting medical insurance costs using regression techniques.
The project aims to provide accurate cost estimations based on individual factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and more,
helping insurance providers and individuals make informed decisions.  

Features:-  
- Regression Models:- Implementation of Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge, and other advanced models for cost prediction.  
- Dataset:- Utilizes a medical insurance dataset with features like age, gender, region, and lifestyle factors.  
- Data Preprocessing:- Comprehensive steps for handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.  
- Performance Evaluation:- Model evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).  
- Insights:- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key factors influencing insurance costs.  

This repository serves as a practical example of applying regression in the healthcare domain, ideal for learning and deploying predictive models for real-world applications.
